#Backend-Instructions
1. Please find attached code for backend inside Backend Directory.
I worked on this project in one of my coursework project. The code is running. Please follow the following steps to run the code:

Please install Apache Tomcat version 8.5. 
Start Tomcat and deploy the code. 
Put the war file (attached with this mail under the name Backend.war) in the Webapps folder. 
Go to Apache/bin directory and run startup.bat on windows. 

Since, this is only the backend code, to access this you can use the portal Postman. 
The code contains the webservice code for the backend.

2. Please find attached code for the front-end inside the WebContent Directory. 
This code is the part of the same code for the above part. However, I am attaching the HTML and CSS files to describe about a viewable front-end page. It also contains JSP pages which need service calls, however, for viewable front-end pages, I have converted some of the JSP pages to HTML pages.
